# Variables Used to Predict
- All-time High/Low, Mean, & Median Values
  # Time Series Decomposition is a technique to extract multiple types of variation from your dataset. There are three essential components in the temporal data of a time series:
  - Seasonality: is a recurring movement present in your time series variable. For example, a place's temperature will be higher in the summer months and lower in the winter months. You could compute    average monthly temperatures and use this seasonality as a basis for forecasting future values.
  - A Trend: can be a long-term upward or downward pattern. A trend could be present in a temperature time series due to global warming. For example, on top of the summer/winter seasonality, you may see a       slight increase in average temperatures over time.
  - Noise: is the part of a time series's variability that can neither be explained by seasonality nor by a trend. When building models, you combine different components into a mathematical formula. Two parts of such a formula can be seasonality and trend. A model that combines both will never perfectly represent the temperature values; an error will always remain. This is represented by the noise factor.
